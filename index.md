## Design & implementation

### Parser
The purpose of the parser is to the command that the user has typed in and return its respective command
object. The class diagram below is a brief overview of how the Parser is related to other classes.

Below is a step by step example on how the parser is used when a user keys in an input.
Assuming the input is not going to be **null** or **blank**,

Step 1)<br>
Lets assume the input passed in is `delete 1/2`. The method `getCommand()` would then split the user's
input into an array of strings along the spaces and store them in the array `listOfInputs`. After which,
it will get the user's command from the 0th array element and store it in another variable called `commandInString`.
<br>

Step 2)<br>
The method will then parse `commandInString` through the switch cases and try to match it with
one of the known commands. If it is able to match it with a command, the method will instantiate
it's respective command object and return it. Else it would return an `unnknownCommandClass` instead.
Below is a sequence diagram modeling how the function works.

#### Alternate implementation

Initially we thought of having each command's respective functions to be executed inside the switch statement.
A rough example of the `delete` and `add` function can be seen below.
```
case "delete":
    functionToDeleteTask(input);
    break;
case "add":
    functionToAddTask(input);
    break;
```

The upside of doing would be that there is less code overall.
However, doing so would cause our code to have a higher amount of coupling and would also cause the code to be
messier and therefore harder to read. By having a command class for each respective command, this allows us
to segregate all the necessary functions for each command in their own respective class, therefore making
testing easier.

## Product scope
### Target user profile

* User has good typing skills.
* Is comfortable without GUI.
* Tends to make large orders of food.
* Wishes to track multiple different orders of food.

### Value proposition

* Large orders can be confusing to keep track, especially if orders are to different stores.
* Allows users to keep track of bulk orders easily.
* Easily keep track of costs.
* Ensures that no orders are left out.
* Knows which order belongs to which store.
* Allow flexibility and control over what description you would like of your friends.
* Users are able to delete/edit entries quickly.
* Comments on the food can also be described by you (e.g. No meat for BanMian).
