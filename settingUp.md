## Setting up the project
:exclamation: **Important:** Follow these steps carefully prior to amending or running any test.
The code might not work as intended if you omit certain steps along the way.<br>
```
It is strongly recommended to use an IDE that supports Gradle. (e.g, Intellij IDEA)
```

1) Fork the entire repo from GitHub & clone it to your own machine.
2) Configure your IDE to operate with **JDK 11**.
3) Import the project as a **Gradle** project. 
    - :exclamation: Not doing so might cause certain tests/files to fail.
4) Run the **main** function in `Duke.java` or run using Gradle to test some of the commands and ensure
that the code works as intended.
